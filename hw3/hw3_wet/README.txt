provided are some very basic tests.

How to run:
	1) extract sample_tests.zip
	2) copy your submission folder there (it should be in the same directory as elf64.h and tests)
		please note that your folder should adhere to final submission structure (.zip, part1/hw3_part1.c part2/hw3_part2.ld)
	3) open the teminal
	4) you may need to run chmod+x ./run_tests.sh
	5) run ./run_tests.sh

Best of luck :)
